#object oriented programming
  object
  class
  inheritance
  polymorphosm
  abstraction
  encapsulation
  interface

class 
    class is a template 
    class is a blueprint

object
    repressentatives of bank
    manager=bank
    state,behariour
    object-combination of stats and behaviars
    object-interest ,accopen ,address changes
    object-represents class
    object is memory reference of a class


templates
    bank
    customer care
    office
    airport
    bus stand
    suber markcet

(in python ,everything is object
class is a template /blue print)

multiparadiym language
    poradigm(idea)


inheritance:
    an object of one class behaving as an object of another class 
    humanbeing -template-class
    object-states and behaviour
        states 
        behaviour

reusability
    another person writing code modules name use another person that is a code reuseability

    reuseability saporting methods
        inheritance
        polymorphism
        abstraction

encapsulation (data binding )
    human being -personal -atm-lock -diary-->personal
    personal -friends -->module
    relational 
    public

patent child -->loosly coupled relationship

abstraction(data hiding)(synopsis)(functions)-->related
    ex:
        car :class -->steering ,gear,acce,cluth,brake
    showing only the necessary data and hiding the unwanted one 

polymorphism    (poly-->many)
    showing different faces at different places
